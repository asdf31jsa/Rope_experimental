pip install:
- cupy (when on cuda12), or cupy-cuda11x (when on cuda11)
- imageio

11.9.24:
- added X/Y-axis offset sliders for mouth restorer and for eyes restorer
- added eyes spacing offset slider for eyes restorer (o ---- o, o -- o)
- added on/off switch for FinalBlurSlider
- added back vanilla "overall mask blend" (dont know if usefull)
- gamma slider (color) increase rate 0.2 -> 0.1
- small gui changes
- 
8.9.24:
- added eye/mouth mask blur slider for the edges of the mask (for "Restore Eyes" and "Restore Mouth")
- added noise slider for face (active when "Color Adjustment" is activated)
- 1 input file per row instead of 2. increased size of input thumbnails and longer filenames. 
- reduced hight of found faces area, so preview gets bigger
  
7.9.24 added:
- "show compare". like "show mask", but with original face instead of the mask. 
- second restorer with seperate parameters
- Final Face Blurring (at end of pipeline), so you can "over restore" and blur it afterwards.
- color transfer from target face to swapped face (4 experimantel versions for testing)
- seperate Blend sliders for mask manipulation + diffing (Occlusion/Xseg Blur, Faceparser Blur, Background Facceparser Blur, Face Diffing Blur)
- Jpeg Compression effect for faces (for low quality targets. and topaz likes it in my experience)
